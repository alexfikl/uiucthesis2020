\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

This project would not have been possible without the support of
many people. Many thanks to my adviser, Lawrence T. Strongarm, who
read my numerous revisions and helped make some sense of the
confusion. Also thanks to my committee members, Reginald Bottoms,
Karin Vegas, and Cindy Willy, who offered guidance and support.
Thanks to the University of Illinois Graduate College for awarding
me a Dissertation Completion Fellowship, providing me with the
financial means to complete this project. And finally, thanks to
my husband, parents, and numerous friends who endured this long
process with me, always offering support and love.
